        "This notebook demonstrates how to train custom openWakeWord models using pre-defined datasets and an automated process for dataset generation and training. While not guaranteed to always produce the best performing model, the methods shown in this notebook often produce baseline models with releatively strong performance.\n",

        "At a high level, the automatic training process takes advantages of several techniques to try and produce a good model, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Early-stopping and checkpoint averaging (similar to [stochastic weight averaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05407)) to search for the best models found during training, according to the validation data\n",
        "- Variable learning rates with cosine decay and multiple cycles\n",
        "- Adaptive batch construction to focus on only high-loss examples when the model begins to converge, combined with gradient accumulation to ensure that batch sizes are still large enough for stable training\n",
        "- Cycical weight schedules for negative examples to help the model reduce false-positive rates\n",

Either version can be used as normal with `openwakeword`.
